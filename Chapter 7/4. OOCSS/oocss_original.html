            <h1>Idiot Tags</h1>
            <p>
                I love idiot tags. You know what I’m talking about: the labels, signs, and 
                other message holders that tell you not to do things that you would never 
                do anyway. Common sense makes them redundant. And yet, you know that many 
                of them exist because somebody actually did do it, and the rest of us 
                have to put up with the inane messages. I’m sure lawyers are to blame for 
                a fair share of them. This is one I noticed while waiting on my coworker 
                to get our Hertz rental car at the Hartford airport. When I read it, I 
                burst out laughing, imagining somebody actually trying to drive around 
                with the idiot tag hanging there.
